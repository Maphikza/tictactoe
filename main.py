"""
My approach to creating this solution has been to think about the number of moves possible in the game and
the number of possible winning combinations. I realised that it would be possible to boil down the winning
combinations to 8 winning combinations if you sort the numbers in ascending order. My solution to this problem is based
on this approach. This solution is not perfect, but it works for most cases. If I had more time or could do it again,
I would play around with a few more approaches like trying to use list indexes for checking for winners.
